Simple project made for foundation course of odin project.
The goal was to build a web app that will look like and act like Etch a sketch.
Main features asked for was to be able to "draw" when you hover over white surface,
it was more logical to me to make it click and hover because the way it works in Etch A Sketch
is similar to that. Required feature was to be able to change colors and size of the screen.
Bonus feature was to add rainbow button that would randomly change between rainbow colors, 
but rainbow was kinda casuall so I added my own pallet under name summer.

This app was built without any frameworks with only plane javascript, html and css.
